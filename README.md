## Contributors

## Requirements 

- R (≥ version 4.5.1)
- R packages: `metafor`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `purrr`, `readr`

## Installation

1. Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/yi-wen-tung/Shift-Work-Psychosis-meta-analysis.git

2. Install the required R packages:

install.packages(c("metafor", "dplyr", "tidyr", "purrr", "readr"))

Usage
The analysis contains two main scripts:

effect_size.R: Calculates effect sizes for individual studies
meta.R: Conducts the main meta-analysis

**Run each script separately in R:**
1. Effect Size Calculations (effect_size.R)
This script:

Loads necessary packages
Converts different effect size measures (Standardized Mean Difference and Odds Ratio) to Hedges' g 
Saves the data to a new CSV file

2. Meta-Analysis (meta.R)
This script:

Loads the effect size data calculated in effect_size.R
Conducts a random-effects meta-analysis using rma function from metafor package
Creates a forest plot displaying individual study effect sizes, the overall effect, and risk of bias assessments
Generates a Baujat plot to help identify influential studies
Conducts Influence and Outlier Analysis for sensetivity
Calculates the Q-statistic and I² values for heterogeneity
